# hello-world

Hello Sugar Labs,

My name is Tiffany Trinh. I am a current high school senior. Right now, I am learning Java and Python, and I hope to learn C++ at some point. My intended major is computer science and engineering.
My favorite foods include pizza, chicken alfredo pasta, and Korean barbecue.

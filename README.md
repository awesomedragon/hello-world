# hello-world

Hello Sugar Labs,

My name is Tiffany Trinh. I am a current high school senior. Right now, I am learning Java and Python, and I hope to learn C++ at some point. My intended major is computer science and engineering.
My favorite foods include pizza, chicken alfredo pasta, and Korean barbecue.


Heyo! How's it going?

Tyffical, you're my first GitHub follower. So, I thought, I should also make my first pull request on your hello-world repo. You're okay with this, right?
